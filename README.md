slighty-after-dark
==================

### What?

* Have you seen how awesome [bryanbraun/after-dark-css](https://github.com/bryanbraun/after-dark-css) is!?
* Seriously? Have you? Go look
* I love everything about this project
* Afterdark takes me back to the 90s
* Flying toasters should include Nevermind on repeat
* I wanted this as my screensaver, so I made one

### Todo

* I tossed this together on Saturday night
* ~~I need to finish the configuration panel~~
* ~~I need to setup after-dark-css as a git submodule~~
* ~~I need to add build steps to pull in screensavers, from the submodule, with each build~~
* ~~I need to make the savers load from local resources~~
* I need to clean up the code
* I need to buy bryanbraun a beer
* Pull saver list from a plist
